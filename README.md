## Problems with the brother

Denis had to face, at the beginning of his reign, the opposition of his younger brother, Infante Afonso. The main reason for his opposition to his brother would be based on an argument with little credit: Afonso claimed his right to the throne as he considered Denis a bastard since he was born before the legalization of his parents' marriage, with Afonso III of Portugal still officially and legally married to Matilde II, Countess of Bologna.

Afonso III's second marriage was only legitimated in 1263 when Denis was already two years old, and Afonso would still be born later that year. The claim was not considered valid precisely because the parents' marriage ended up being legitimized, but a conflict ended up between them in 1281.

Afonso was in Vide, and he walled this village, a sign that did not seem correct to Denis, who saw it as a sign of war, so he moved with an army there, and Afonso eventually fled to Seville.

## Administration and Justice

Denis was essentially an administrator and not a warrior king: getting involved in a war with the Kingdom of Castile in 1295, he gave it up in exchange for the villages of Serpa and Moura.
Denis would follow his father in the politics of legislation and centralization of power, and enacted one of the first legislative codes, protecting the lower classes from abuse and extortion. These laws survived as part of the Book of Laws and Postures and the Afonsina Ordinances, written in the reign of Alfonso V of Portugal. These codes of law were compilations of municipal laws and customary law, amended and reformulated by the Crown.

Indeed, the incidence of procedural issues with equal weight to the positive law character of its laws denounces the king's growing concern in framing customary (or customary) law within the scope of the Crown, and in effecting his power on the ground. The determinations on the performance of alvazis (municipal officers), judges, attorneys, and lawyers demonstrate this, since a merely nominal power over all the inhabitants of the Kingdom, as was typical in the Middle Ages, is not compatible with this effort to break down the procedures or in moralizing the exercise of justice. The creation of magistrates denounces the beginning of the territorialization process of the Crown's jurisdiction, going beyond the royal domain, along with the growing importance of the capital of Lisbon.

The reign of D. Denis accentuated the predilection for Lisbon as the place of residence of the royal court. It was not an official capital, but Lisbon's location, its urban, economic, and mercantile development make it the most capable of exercising the function of an administrative center.
The articulation between the north and south of the country — this south that has become the target of the greatest attention and permanence of the kings — makes Lisbon a revolving center for making Portugal viable. Between the north, where the seigneurial grid is denser and tighter, and the south, where the vast space conquered from the Muslims mainly deploys royal domains and military orders, as well as vast spaces of res nullius and makes Portugal a kingdom where two realities are different ones complement each other.
