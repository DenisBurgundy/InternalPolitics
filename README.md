## Problems with the brother

Denis had to face, at the beginning of his reign, the opposition of his younger brother, Infante Afonso. The main reason for his opposition to his brother would be based on an argument with little credit: Afonso claimed his right to the throne as he considered Denis a bastard since he was born before the legalization of his parents' marriage, with Afonso III of Portugal still officially and legally married to Matilde II, Countess of Bologna.

Afonso III's second marriage was only legitimated in 1263 when Denis was already two years old, and Afonso would still be born later that year. The claim was not considered valid precisely because the parents' marriage ended up being legitimized, but a conflict ended up between them in 1281.

Afonso was in Vide, and he walled this village, a sign that did not seem correct to Denis, who saw it as a sign of war, so he moved with an army there, and Afonso eventually fled to Seville.
