## Problems with the brother

Denis had to face, at the beginning of his reign, the opposition of his younger brother, Infante Afonso. The main reason for his opposition to his brother would be based on an argument with little credit: Afonso claimed his right to the throne as he considered Denis a bastard since he was born before the legalization of his parents' marriage, with Afonso III of Portugal still officially and legally married to Matilde II, Countess of Bologna.

Afonso III's second marriage was only legitimated in 1263 when Denis was already two years old, and Afonso would still be born later that year. The claim was not considered valid precisely because the parents' marriage ended up being legitimized, but a conflict ended up between them in 1281.

Afonso was in Vide, and he walled this village, a sign that did not seem correct to Denis, who saw it as a sign of war, so he moved with an army there, and Afonso eventually fled to Seville.

## Administration and Justice

Denis was essentially an administrator and not a warrior king: getting involved in a war with the Kingdom of Castile in 1295, he gave it up in exchange for the villages of Serpa and Moura.
Denis would follow his father in the politics of legislation and centralization of power, and enacted one of the first legislative codes, protecting the lower classes from abuse and extortion. These laws survived as part of the Book of Laws and Postures and the Afonsina Ordinances, written in the reign of Alfonso V of Portugal. These codes of law were compilations of municipal laws and customary law, amended and reformulated by the Crown.

Indeed, the incidence of procedural issues with equal weight to the positive law character of its laws denounces the king's growing concern in framing customary (or customary) law within the scope of the Crown, and in effecting his power on the ground. The determinations on the performance of alvazis (municipal officers), judges, attorneys, and lawyers demonstrate this, since a merely nominal power over all the inhabitants of the Kingdom, as was typical in the Middle Ages, is not compatible with this effort to break down the procedures or in moralizing the exercise of justice. The creation of magistrates denounces the beginning of the territorialization process of the Crown's jurisdiction, going beyond the royal domain, along with the growing importance of the capital of Lisbon.

The reign of D. Denis accentuated the predilection for Lisbon as the place of residence of the royal court. It was not an official capital, but Lisbon's location, its urban, economic, and mercantile development make it the most capable of exercising the function of an administrative center.
The articulation between the north and south of the country — this south that has become the target of the greatest attention and permanence of the kings — makes Lisbon a revolving center for making Portugal viable. Between the north, where the seigneurial grid is denser and tighter, and the south, where the vast space conquered from the Muslims mainly deploys royal domains and military orders, as well as vast spaces of res nullius and makes Portugal a kingdom where two realities are different ones complement each other.

## Military architecture Renovation

At the end of the 13th century, European military architecture had undergone a series of changes that changed the profile of buildings and dictated radical innovations in the military tactics of attacking and defending a castle, making them able not only to defend (as did the Romanesque castles) but also to attack, according to the new typologies of Gothic architecture.

Philip II of France was the great pioneer of this great movement, undertaking several alterations in several of its castles, endowing them with these new means that made them more resistant to the frequent attacks suffered in a France that was still clearly feudal.
In Portugal, Sancho I improved the defensive system in Coimbra, with the construction of the towers of Quinária (1198) and Belcouce (1211), the Hospital Order erected the Castle of Belver already with new means, in the face of the invasion they suffered in 1190 of Abu Iúçufe Iacube Almançor and the Order of the Templars introduced changes that reveal knowledge of architecture then practiced in the Holy Land and the Near East, innovations brought by Gualdim Pais, Master of the Order who witnessed the Second Crusade, having taken part in a siege in Antioquia and the taking of Ashkelon (1153).
However, the pressure of Muslim invasions and a protracted series of bad agricultural years caused increased spending on the national economy, which halted the continuous renovation of several castles.

It was precise with Afonso III and Denis that the situation changed, as the State's coffers were once again full. If Afonso III introduced the first alteration to the wall of Melgaço in 1263, which had become the first example of the adaptation of the new architecture brought from France by the Count of Bologna, it would nevertheless be Denis who would be deeply committed to a project to reform military architecture in large scale, probably one of the most ambitious in the entire history of the kingdom and which would be continued by his distant descendants, João II of Portugal and Manuel I of Portugal.
